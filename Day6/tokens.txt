Access Token vs Refresh Token (Simple)
    Access Token
        A short-lived token (e.g., 15 minutes to 1 hour).
        Sent with every API request to prove the user is logged in.
        Usually stored in memory or an HttpOnly cookie.
        If it expires, the user needs a new one to keep using protected routes.

    Refresh Token
        A long-lived token (days or weeks).
        Used only to get a new access token without making the user log in again.
        Stored securely in an HttpOnly cookie.
        Sent to a special endpoint (like /refresh_token) to get a fresh access token.

Why use both?
    Access tokens keep your app secure by expiring quickly.
    Refresh tokens improve user experience by allowing silent re-login.

Basic flow:
    User logs in â†’ gets access token + refresh token.
    Use access token to call APIs.
    When access token expires, use refresh token to get a new access token.
    If refresh token expires or is invalid, user must log in again.
