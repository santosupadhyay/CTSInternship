Nodejs 
    - Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, mainly used for building fast and scalable backend/server-side applications.

Features of Nodejs
    Built on Chrome’s V8 engine
    Uses Event-driven, Non-blocking I/O
    Executes code asynchronously
    Great for real-time applications

Real-life Analogy:
Imagine a waiter in a restaurant (Node.js server):

    Takes orders (requests)
    Doesn't wait at the kitchen (doesn’t block)
    Takes the next order immediately
    Delivers food when it's ready (callback)

This is how Node.js handles multiple client requests efficiently without getting stuck.
